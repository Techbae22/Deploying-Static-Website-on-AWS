# Deploying-Static-Website-on-AWS
Hosting a static website that only includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that requires no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

Hosting a static website on S3 and
Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service.
In this project, I was able to deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

Created a public S3 bucket and uploaded the website files to my bucket.
Configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies.
Sped up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
Accessed the website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
